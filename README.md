## 🛠️ Requirements & Setup

- Flutter SDK installed
- A Firebase project (Android is preconfigured; iOS/web/desktop require your own configuration)

1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxstain/dice_master.git
cd dice_master
```

2) Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3) Configure Firebase (if you plan to run on platforms other than Android)

- Android: android/app/google-services.json exists in the repo.
- iOS: add ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist and ensure iOS setup is complete.
- Web/desktop: this project uses lib/firebase_options.dart (generated by FlutterFire). If you change
  your Firebase project, run `flutterfire configure` and commit the updated file.

4) Run the app

- Mobile (Android/iOS)
  ```bash
  flutter run -d android
  flutter run -d ios
  ```
- Web
  ```bash
  flutter run -d chrome
  ```
- Desktop (Windows)
  ```bash
  flutter run -d windows
  ```
