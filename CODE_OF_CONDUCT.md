# Our Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability (physical or mental).
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive,
and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the
  experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Striving to understand and be supportive of peopleâ€™s different backgrounds, identities, and
  experiences
* Treating all communication with respect, even when there are disagreements
* Acknowledging the existence of implicit bias and working to eliminate it in ourselves and our
  community

## Our Responsibilities

and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.
Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
